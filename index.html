        <p>"It was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing," he said. "This is going to sound funny
          and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I'd love to get together and
          tell you about it if you're up for a cup of coffee," he continued, laying the trapped he's been planning for
          years.</p>

        <p>Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. Even colors that had no
          business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. How was she going to
          explain this to the others?</p>

        <p>Do you think you're living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken it's difficult to even explain. The mere
          fact that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery, but
          here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass?</p>

        <p>It wasn't quite yet time to panic. There was still time to salvage the situation. At least that is what she
          was telling himself. The reality was that it was time to panic and there wasn't time to salvage the situation,
          but he continued to delude himself into believing there was.</p>

        <p>There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism
          and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he didn't
          understand where it came from. It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him.

        <p>He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice
          so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if
          he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.</p>
